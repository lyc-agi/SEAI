# SEAI
Self-evolving Artificial Intelligence(SEAI)  
based on the intelligence theory of Liu Yichuan.

This project is based on the idea that artificial general intelligence (AGI) can evolve through relatively simple initial states and rules. Although general artificial intelligence can also be directly designed, it is relatively complex and difficult, and does not conform to the original intention of intelligence: to improve efficiency.
